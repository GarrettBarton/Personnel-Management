# Personnel-Management
Sanitized documents and documentation for personnel management leveraging MS Teams and cloud-based Excel Online to enable efficient and effective split-based personnel management. I'll attach some articles that formed the theoretical foundations.


## Why make these?
Managing large groups split over several buildings across a city-sized area with the need to manage dozens of trackable training, administrative, and personal aspects becomes too much without leveraging technology. I'm putting the documents here as a portfolio as LinkedIn is more of a long-form interactive resume.

## Future development?
I developed these workbooks/sheets and the development will continue until information requirements cease (so never). These are meant to be workspaces specifically designed to communicate information requirements.

## Support?
If you find this and want to use the sanitized workbooks to help with your situation or if you want Excel help with something else please reach out on LinkedIn. I like Excel and I've gotten good at it, but I can't commit enough time to make money off Excel work alone, so here we are.



Note (20231225): I need to sanitize the workbooks enough for the open internet. I made a version for sharing around my business (military), so the information I left wasn't a concern. Y'all are going to get lorem ipsum lol
